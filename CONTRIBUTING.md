# How do I make a code contribution?

Are you new to open source contribution? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here's a quick rundown.

Find an issue that you're interested in addressing, or a feature that you'd like to add.

## Step 1: Make a fork

Fork the `product-database` repository to your GitHub account. This means that you'll have a copy of the repository under _your-GitHub-username/repository-name_.

## Step 2: Clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/{your-GitHub-username}/product-database.git
```

## Step 3: Setup the development environment
Read [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) to setup your development environment.

## Step 4: Create a branch

Create a new branch for your fix.

```
git checkout -b branch-name-here
```

## Step 5: Make your changes

Update the code with your bug fix or new feature.

## Step 6: Add the changes that are ready to be committed

Stage the changes that are ready to be committed:

```
git add .
```

## Step 7: Commit the changes

Commit the changes with a short message.

```
git commit -m "<subject>"
```

## Step 8: Push the changes to the remote repository

Push the changes to the remote repository using:

```
git push origin branch-name-here
```

## Step 9: Create Pull Request

In GitHub, do the following to submit a pull request to the upstream repository:

1.  Give the pull request a title and a short description of the changes made. Include also the issue or bug number associated with your change. Explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer.

Remember, it's okay if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request ever is). The reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!

2.  Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.

3.  Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.

Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged :)
